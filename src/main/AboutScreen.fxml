Data breaches compromise the security and privacy of individuals' sensitive information, including personal and financial data. When data breaches occur, hackers gain unauthorized access to this information, potentially leading to identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities. It is useful to know when your data has been exposed because it allows people to take proactive measures to protect themselves, such as changing passwords, monitoring financial accounts for suspicious activity, and implementing additional security measures. Our project aims to inform users about data breaches to empower them to mitigate potential risks and safeguard their personal information from further exploitation." textAlignment="JUSTIFY" wrappingWidth="475.7366943359375" />
